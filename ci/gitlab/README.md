# Automation scripts for GitLab CI

Currently, the only automation process for the OpenStudio Server repository that is being migrated to GitLab CI is Amazon Machine Image (AMI) generation for commits to the master branch of the repository. 

## AMI generation script

To execute the AMI automation script `build_deploy_ami.py` in this folder several software dependencies are required. Please note that this script was written for execution on Ubuntu 17.04. First, docker version 17.09.01-ce is required. Notes for installing this are available on [the wiki](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-server/wiki/User-OpenStudio-Server-Deployment). Next, [packer](https://www.packer.io/) version 1.1.3 or later is required. Finally, python version 2.7.13 or later is required, as well as the python extension pip. To ensure that docker, packer, and python are available, please run the following in a bash shell.

```sh
$ docker --version

Docker version 17.12.0-ce, build c97c6d6

$ packer --version

1.1.3

$ python --version

Python 2.7.13
```

Once the above dependencies are installed, please execute the following command in a bash shell in this folder.

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

wheel (0.30.0)
```

Please ensure all packages listed are not older than those listed above. When installing against a clean python build, this should not present an issue. At this point, the only remaining dependency is an access key and secret key for the appropriate NREL aws account. If you don't know what these are, you probably shouldn't have them, but feel free to ask. In this example, the fake access key will be `ABCDEFABCDEFABCDEF` and the fake secret key will be `!1qa@2ws#3ed$4rf%5tg^6yh&7uj*8ik(9ol)0p;`. The automated AMI generation command is documented in the shell as follows.

```sh
$ python build_deploy_ami.py -h

usage: build_deploy_ami.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [--generated_by GENERATED_BY]
                           [--docker_version DOCKER_VERSION]
                           [--ami_version AMI_VERSION]
                           [--ami_extension AMI_EXTENSION] [-n NOTES] [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Absolute path to the directory to write the output log
                        to
  --generated_by GENERATED_BY
                        Overwrite the Author metadata field
  --docker_version DOCKER_VERSION
                        Overwrite the docker version in the AMI
  --ami_version AMI_VERSION
                        Overwrite the AMI version
  --ami_extension AMI_EXTENSION
                        Overwrite the AMI version extension
  -n NOTES, --notes NOTES
                        Provide notes to be persisted in the amis.json entry
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output
```

For general use, the only flags used are `-v` to enable verbose outputs (useful in the logs should things go awry), `-o` to allow for the log of the `packer` build process to be stored as an artefact in case of automation failure, `-n` to provide provenance information to consumers of the AMI, and `--generated_by` to allow for delineation between builds generated by individuals and the GitLab CI. Currently, the preferred text in notes is `Official automated release of OpenStudio Server X.Y.Z by NREL`.

The below is an example of executing this script.

```sh
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFABCDEFABCDEF

$ export AWS_SECRET_KEY=!1qa@2ws#3ed$4rf%5tg^6yh&7uj*8ik(9ol)0p;

$ python build_deploy_ami.py --generated_by "Ry Horsey" -n "Official automated release of OpenStudio Server 2.4.1 by NREL" -v

```

## Build process

This script should only ever be run after the successful completion of a build of the master branch of this repo on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/NREL/OpenStudio-server). This automatically pushes tested docker images to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nrel) for both the [OpenStudio Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/nrel/openstudio-server/tags/) and [OpenStudio Rserve](https://hub.docker.com/r/nrel/openstudio-rserve/tags/) images. These two images are what is provisioned within the AMI built, and as such have to be created as DockerHub artefacts beforehand. For the purposes of automation, however, a successful CircleCI build on the master branch is sufficient for executing the `build_deploy_ami.py` script.

This script begins by collecting version information from the repository. This requires the cloned repository to have the same SHA as the successful CircleCI build, i.e. latest master. This information, along with the AWS access and secret keys, is used to execute packer. Packer spins up a small (c3.xlarge) server from a base Ubuntu AMI. This server then is configured based off of the [packer JSON file](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-server/blob/develop/docker/deployment/openstudio_server_docker_base.json). The log file of this process is written to the output directory as `build.log` and should be persisted in case of a failure. Upon successful completion of this command, the configured server will be persisted as an AMI before being terminated. 

Following the generation of the AMI, the only remaining tasks are to make the AMI public, and to update the [amis.json](http://s3.amazonaws.com/openstudio-resources/server/api/v3/amis.json) file stored on S3 that defines the available set of AMIs. To ensure the accuracy of all information, the individual docker images used the the AMI are retrieved from DockerHub and commands executed to determine software versions. Upon completion of these steps, the amis.json file is updated on S3.
